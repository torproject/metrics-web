/**
 * Sanitizes bridge descriptors, i.e., removes all possibly sensitive
 * information from them, and writes them to a local directory structure.
 * During the sanitizing process, all information about the bridge
 * identity or IP address are removed or replaced. The goal is to keep the
 * sanitized bridge descriptors useful for statistical analysis while not
 * making it easier for an adversary to enumerate bridges.
 *
 * There are three types of bridge descriptors: bridge network statuses
 * (lists of all bridges at a given time), server descriptors (published
 * by the bridge to advertise their capabilities), and extra-info
 * descriptors (published by the bridge, mainly for statistical analysis).
 *
 * Network statuses, server descriptors, and extra-info descriptors are
 * linked via descriptor digests: extra-info descriptors are referenced
 * from server descriptors, and server descriptors are referenced from
 * network statuses. These references need to be changed during the
 * sanitizing process, because descriptor contents change and so do the
 * descriptor digests.
 *
 * No assumptions are made about the order in which bridge descriptors are
 * parsed. The approach taken here is to sanitize bridge descriptors even
 * with incomplete knowledge about references and to update them as soon
 * as these information get known. We are keeping a persistent data
 * structure, the bridge descriptor mapping, to hold information about
 * every single descriptor. The idea is that every descriptor is (a)
 * referenced from a network status and consists of (b) a server
 * descriptor and (c) an extra-info descriptor, both of which are
 * published at the same time. Using this data structure, we can repair
 * references as soon as we learn more about the descriptor and regardless
 * of the order of incoming bridge descriptors.
 *
 * The process of sanitizing a bridge descriptor is as follows, depending
 * on the type of descriptor:
 *
 * Network statuses are processed by sanitizing every r line separately
 * and looking up whether the descriptor mapping contains a bridge with
 * given identity hash and descriptor publication time. If so, the new
 * server descriptor identifier can be added. If not, we're adding all
 * 0's.
 *
 * While sanitizing a server descriptor, its identity hash and publication
 * time are looked up in order to put in the extra-info descriptor
 * identifier in case the corresponding extra-info descriptor was
 * sanitized before. Further, its publication time is noted down, so that
 * all network statuses that might be referencing this server descriptor
 * can be re-written at the end of the sanitizing procedure.
 *
 * Extra-info descriptors are processed by looking up their identity hash
 * and publication time in the descriptor mapping. If the corresponding
 * server descriptor was sanitized before, the server descriptor is
 * re-written to include the new extra-info descriptor digest, and the
 * publication time is noted down in order to re-write the network
 * statuses possibly referencing this extra-info descriptor and its
 * corresponding server descriptor at the end of the sanitizing process.
 *
 * After sanitizing all bridge descriptors, the network statuses that
 * might be referencing server descriptors which have been (re-)written
 * during this execution are re-written, too. This may be necessary in
 * order to update previously broken references to server descriptors.
